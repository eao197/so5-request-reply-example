This is a follow-up for the comparison of request-reply pattern implementation in C++ actor frameworks: ["Request Response Message Exchange Pattern"](https://basiliscos.github.io/blog/2019/10/05/request-response-message-exchange-pattern/).

Please note that this is a quick-and-dirty reimplementation of SObjectizer's example from that comparison. Because of that, there are only build files for MxxRu build tool only. If you want to have build files for CMake please open an issue.
